Progressive Web Apps by Maximilian Schwarzmuller

- Getting started: What are they?
    1. Features added to any Web pages to enhance them to feel and work like native Web applications.
        - This does not necessarily mean only *responsive.*
    2. Three main descriptors:
        a. Be reliable. Load quick and provide offline functionality.
        b. Fast: Respond quickly to user actions.
        c. Engaging: Feel like a native app on mobile devices.
    3. Mobile Web versus Native Apps. Lighthouse Chrome (as a Chrome extension.)
    4. Our first PWA. Gosh. Starter Kit.
    5. Core Building Blocks
        a. Service workers. JavaScript running in a background process. Even if the application is closed.
        b. Application manifest. Making the application *installable.*
        c. Responsive design.
        d. Geolocation API. Media API. et al.
    6. PWAs versus SPAs.
        a. SPA: Powered by JavaScript. Highly Reactive. Only one HTML file.
        b. PWA: Uses a lot of JavaScript. Aims to be reactive. Works with multiple files.
    7. Progrssive Enhamcement.
